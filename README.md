# img2ascii
A simple python ASCII art generator.
<hr>
To use, download the repo, extract the files where ever you want and run setup.sh.
(Of course the shell file only works on Linux)

On Windows, you will need to install the Pillow library:
https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow

After that just run the img2ascii.py file.

Running it without arguments will tell you how to use it.
